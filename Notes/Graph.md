1. Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.
```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
Output: true
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]
Output: false
```

2.  Longest Consecutive Sequence
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
